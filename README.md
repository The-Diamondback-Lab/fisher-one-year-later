## Getting Started

Dan Fisher was admittedly a bit skeptical of his daughter Maria’s dream to open
a performing arts high school after she graduated from the University of
Maryland.  

But in the year since her death, Fisher has taken his daughter’s dream into his
own hands.  

In mid-February, the Fishers will open The Avenue Guest House and Gallery in
Lititz, Pennsylvania, a bed and breakfast that  will double as a performance
venue for local artists.  

Since the family purchased it in September, it’s become something of a sanctuary
for them, particularly as the investigation into Maria’s death has yielded more
questions than answers.  

On Oct. 1, 2017, just after 6 a.m., Maria Fisher, a first semester freshman, was
struck and killed by a car as she ran across Route 1. But, all these months
later, her loved ones aren’t sure where she was running from.
